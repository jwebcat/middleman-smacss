# SMACSS type starter template for Middleman

If you use [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/), you can download this fileset to use as a starting point for new projects. This is *not* reviewed/approved by Jonathan Snook, just inspired by his [SMACSS](https://smacss.com/) ideas, workshop and book.

## How to use

All you need to do is copy these files into ~/.middleman/ (you'll need to create that folder if it doesn't already exist).  You can read more about project templates on the [Middleman site](http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/welcome/).
